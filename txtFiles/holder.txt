“Mom, can we go to Disneyland?”

“No, sweetie. Maybe one day, but not now, alright?” That’s the response I always got from Mom. I’ve always wanted to go Disneyland. They have Mickey Mouse, Elsa, Simba, Ariel, so many of them. They are fun. My classmates are having fun. Lucas went to Disneyland before in Australia. Ella also went to Disneyland in UK together with Eva.

But my mom and dad never did. Isn’t there one in Germany?

Maybe one day they will?

Oh, I pray to god they can bring me to see this wonderland!

‘Honey, you and her need to get the hell out of here now. The bastards had just crossed the border.’

‘But where should we go…*sobs* What about our sweetheart Daisy? She’s only 4 you know? What if she doesn’t have a dad anymore?’

‘Please! I beg you! You and Daisy are the most precious thing in my life! Just please… I love you. I will definitely make it back alive. Just please, go.’

I peeped from the crack of my bedroom to see both my parents arguing. I don’t know why but they never quarreled that bad. I feel tense these days. Dad wouldn’t laugh nor smile with me. Mom also hugs me more often, but I don’t understand why.

The TV always shows news about green people holding black sticks. The buildings are all black and bricks are all over the ground. I always ask mom why but she never answers me.

I was having a dream of eating a lot of ice cream. But my mom woke me up and dragged me into the car.

“…Mommy? What is happening?”

“Don’t worry, sweetheart. Everything is going to be fine.”

The car stopped. We are in a huge traffic jam. I have never seen so many cars in one road before. But I was very scared when I hear a loud, I mean really loud explosion. I was very scared. I cried. Mommy told me that brave girls don’t cry, but I still cried. Mommy quickly hugged me. Then, another explosion, then another.

‘Oh god, they’re getting closer. Get off the car. We’ll not make it in time.’

Daddy said we need to walk. I hate long walking, but luckily Mommy carried me on her shoulder. I can see many people getting out of their cars. They looked scared like me, even Dad and Mom. I can see large black smokes from behind the trees. Why are things exploding?

We reached a huge tunnel. Inside there’s many people, they seemed to be sad and have nowhere to sleep. My mom said we’re in an underground tunnel. Wow, underground!

But then I saw Dad hugging Mom, then Dad hugs me and cried for the first time. Why did my dad cry? I thought he is brave…

He then walked away.

“Mom? Where is Dad going?”

“…He will come back soon. Let’s go.”

She then hugged and kissed me while sobbing.
